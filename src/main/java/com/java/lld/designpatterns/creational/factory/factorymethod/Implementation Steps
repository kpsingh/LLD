1. You have to create the product Hierarchy :
    a. Product Interface like Button interface
    b.  Product implementation classes like RoundButton, SquareButton, etc

2. Create your Factory Interface : This interface will have one method like createButton();
    It depend  on your high level module that is Interface
3. Create concrete Factory corresponding to each product like RoundButtonFactory, SquareButtonFactory


One Problem with factory method is class EXPLOSION, as we have to create one factory for one type of Button / one implementation type
